                    <h3>Performing:</h3>
                    <p>I am a big advocate of music education because music itself has always been my outlet of expression and my goal when teaching is to make it an outlet for my students as well. Performing and practicing does not have to be stressful, it can become relaxing instead. I always tell my students that my job is to make them the teacher so that they do not need me anymore!</p>

                    </figure>
                    <h3>Theory:</h3>
                    <p>When I teach performance there is often some theory involved with lessons. Theory is an essential part of music because it is history of what has happened or what is "normal." The most important reason for learning theory is to make reading easier and guide expression when playing. We learn the rules of theory so that we can break them in more and more interesting ways! This is often how new music is born and how creativity is spread!</p>

                    <h3>Reed Making:</h3>
                    <p>When students are playing a reeded instrument I find that it is important to give them a reminder that without the vibration of the reed against a mouthpiece, or against itself, we could not produce a sound! Starting around the 3rd year of playing I will often introduce how to adjust reeds or create their own, in the case of double reeds. This gives agency to many students since they are then the creator of their sound production off and on the instrument. Quoting my former professor, "The reed is half the instrument."</p>

                <h2>Why Take Lessons?</h2>
                <img alt="Group of bassoonists with their instruments" src="Images/Bassooners6.jpg">
                <p>Lessons are a great way for students to learn about their instrument, music, and how to practice. Everybody has a favorite way to learn, and lessons are a way for students to explore the different ways we can approach music. I have had students that enjoy learning about difficult excerpts early on, while some prefer to learn pop music on their instrument by ear! If they are playing and enjoying it, they are already way ahead of many other students.</p>
